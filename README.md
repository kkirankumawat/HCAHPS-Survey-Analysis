# HCAHPS-Survey-Analysis
The intent of the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patients’ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its 3 main goals is to "create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care".
This Report contains the Analysis of Survey report published from 2015 to 2023.  The survey was conducted to know the patients experience level with the services provided by the facilities and how they rate the facility. The response of the patients was analyzed and grouped under bottom box, middle box and top box.
# Task: To evaluate whether the HCAHPS survey has been successful in accomplishing this goal by answering questions like these:
•	Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
•	Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
•	Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?
•	What recommendations can be made to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?
